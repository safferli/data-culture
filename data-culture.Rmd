# Test one

<aside class="notes">
Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
</aside>

Note that this is all from the viewpoint of a large, multinational company

### What should data be used for?

- learn from past mistakes and successes
- make correct prediction for the future
- *not* to check the present!

<aside class="notes">
- checking the present is monitoring
- drives behaviour towards the KPIs
</aside>

## Data (mis-)use 

- metrics/KPIs 
- avoid "endless KPI treadmill"
- "illusion of control"

<aside class="notes">
metrics/KPIs: 
- make forecasting ubiquitous (Twitch forecasting)
</aside>


## Responsibility

<small>https://xkcd.com/643/</small>

***

- know KPIs, data, and what they mean
- understand the implications of them! 
    - (pretty is powerful)
- use your data power wisely (this will never happen...)
    - principal-agent theory

<aside class="notes">
- ranking changes efforts! (mechanism design)
- we’re a gaming company – we should be really good at this! 
- metrics drive behavior towards the KPI!
</aside>

## metrics aid decision-making, not short-cut it!

<aside class="notes">
(producer traffic lights)
</aside>

- be humble
- use other people's data: you'll understand their problems and viewpoints
- don't lose the holistic view
