### What should data be used for?

- learn from past mistakes and successes
- make correct prediction for the future
- *not* to check the present!
    - this is monitoring
    - drives behaviour towards the KPIs


---

## Data (mis-)use 

- metrics/KPIs 
    - make forecasting ubiquitous (Twitch forecasting)
- avoid "endless KPI treadmill"
- "illusion of control"

## Responsibility

***

- know KPIs, data, and what they mean
- understand the implications of them! 
    - (pretty is powerful)
