Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

<aside class="notes">
- Note that this is all from the viewpoint of a large, multinational company
- very data-keen, and data-open management
- but sometimes slow, and cumbersome with many stakeholders
</aside>


## Culture

> (2) The ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society  
>   
> [OED definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/culture)

<aside class="notes">
- customs and social behaviour here is key -- how do we _actually_ use data?
- also: *implicit contracts*
</aside>


## Data

<aside class="notes">
- data can be anything: an idea, your Word document, a business plan
- we are used to thinking data is only _highly structured, digital data_
</aside>


# State of the Union {data-background="./data-culture_files/img/business-rabbid.png"}

## What should data be used for?

- learn from past and current mistakes and successes
- make correct predictions for the future
- checking the present: monitoring
- _evaluate_, but not _check_ or _review_!

<aside class="notes">
- _evaluating_  is good! (peers evaluate, superiors check and monitor)
- checking the present is monitoring
- BUT: we will see that this drives behaviour towards the KPIs
  - doctors with "track records" refuse to operate on older patients
</aside>


## Data (mis-)use 

- metrics and KPIs drive behaviour
- data as substitute for a trusted opinion
    - gather data at great cost
    - avoid endless KPI treadmill
    - illusion of control

<aside class="notes">
- rather than trust informed judgement of experts, we gather meaningless numbers at great cost
- metrics/KPIs: 
    - 4Ts: teaching to the test
- make forecasting ubiquitous (Twitch forecasting)
</aside>


## Responsibility

<small>https://xkcd.com/643/</small>

***

- know KPIs, data, and what they mean
- understand their implications
    - (pretty is powerful)
- teach your organisation 
- use your data power wisely 
    - principal-agent theory
    - mechanism design

## data culture means using other people's data! 

<aside class="notes">
- ALSO let them use your data!
- know/share
    - viewpoints
    - problems
    - strengths
</aside>


# Action plan {data-background="./data-culture_files/img/actionplan-rabbid.png"}

</aside>


## understand human behaviour

![](./data-culture_files/img/psychiatrist-no-friends.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
- ranking changes efforts (mechanism design)
- metrics drive behavior towards the KPI
- we’re a gaming company – we should be really good at this! 
</aside>

## metrics aid decision-making, not short-cut it!

- be humble
- use (and share) other people's data
- don't lose the holistic view

<aside class="notes">
- (producer traffic lights)
- us analysts always use metrics for decision-making in areas we have little expertise
</aside>
