Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

# Situation {data-background="./data-culture_files/img/business-rabbid.png"}

## What should data be used for?

- learn from past mistakes and successes
- make correct predictions for the future
- *not* to check the present!

<aside class="notes">
- checking the present is monitoring
- BUT: we will see that this drives behaviour towards the KPIs
- doctors with "track records" refuse to operate on older patients
</aside>


## Data (mis-)use 

- metrics and KPIs drive behaviour
- data as substitute for a trusted opinion
    - avoid "endless KPI treadmill"
    - "illusion of control"

<aside class="notes">
Rather than rely on the informed judgment of people familiar with the situation, we gather meaningless numbers at great cost. 
metrics/KPIs: 
- 4Ts: teaching to the test
- make forecasting ubiquitous (Twitch forecasting)
</aside>


## Responsibility

<small>https://xkcd.com/643/</small>

***

- know KPIs, data, and what they mean
- understand the implications of them! 
    - (pretty is powerful)
- teach your organisation data skills
- use your data power wisely (this will never happen...)
    - principal-agent theory

***

data culture means using other people's data! 

<aside class="notes">
- know their viewpoints
- know their problems
- know their strengths

## understand human behaviour

![](./data-culture_files/img/psychiatrist-no-friends.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
- ranking changes efforts! (mechanism design)
- we’re a gaming company – we should be really good at this! 
- metrics drive behavior towards the KPI!
</aside>

## metrics aid decision-making, not short-cut it!

<aside class="notes">
- (producer traffic lights)
- us analysts always use metrics for decision-making in areas we have little expertise
</aside>

- be humble
- use other people's data: you'll understand their problems and viewpoints
- don't lose the holistic view
