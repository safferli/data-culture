## Data at Ubisoft

metrics/KPIs 
avoid "endless KPI treadmill"
see through "illusion of control"

### what is data used for?

- learn from past mistakes and successes
- make correct prediction for the future
- *not* to check the present!
    - this is monitoring
    - drives behaviour towards the KPIs

## Responsibility

https://xkcd.com/643/

- understand KPIs, data, and what they mean
- understand the implications of them! 
    (pretty is powerful)

## action plan 

- get experts on board
- learn from mistakes (difficult, als decision-making is intransparent)
- don't be deluded into thinking you have reached understanding
- understand human behaviour: ranking changes efforts! (mechanism design)
- metrics aid decision-making, not short-cut it
